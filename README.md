## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project uses manual deployment to GitHub Pages via the GitHub web interface.

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository named `fish_agents`
2. **Do NOT** initialize with README (you already have one)
3. Create the repository

### Step 2: Push Your Source Code

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Bend Fishing Guide"

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fish_agents.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Build Your Project Locally

```bash
# Build the production bundle
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with your built application.

### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Manual)

#### Initial Deployment

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Under **Branch**, select **main** and **/(root)**
5. Click **Save**

6. **Upload your built files to the repository root:**
   - Go to your repository's **Code** tab
   - Click the **Add file** → **Upload files** button
   - Navigate to your local `dist/` folder
   - **Upload all files from the dist folder** (including `index.html`, `assets/` folder, etc.)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Upload these files directly to the repository root (the same level as package.json, src/, etc.)
   - Scroll to the bottom and commit with message: "Deploy to GitHub Pages"

7. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to deploy
8. Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/fish_agents/`

#### Updating Your Site

After making changes:

```bash
# 1. Commit and push source code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push

# 2. Rebuild the project
npm run build
```

Then in GitHub web interface:
1. Go to **Code** tab
2. Click **Add file** → **Upload files**
3. Upload all files from your local `dist/` folder to the repository root (this will overwrite previous files)
4. Commit with message: "Update deployment"

### Troubleshooting Deployment

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 404 Error | Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to deploy, or check Pages settings |
| Blank Page | Verify `vite.config.ts` has correct `base: '/fish_agents/'` |
| Styles Missing | Ensure all files from `dist/` are uploaded, including the `assets/` folder |
| Old version showing | Clear browser cache or try incognito mode |

### Important Notes

- Upload files to the **repository root** (same level as package.json, src/, public/, etc.)
- Always upload **ALL files** from the `dist/` folder, including subdirectories
- The `dist/` folder is created/overwritten each time you run `npm run build`
- Do NOT edit files in the `dist/` folder - edit source files and rebuild
- GitHub Pages serves from the root of your repository, not from a subdirectory
- When uploading, you'll see existing files like package.json, src/, etc. - the new dist files will be added alongside them
